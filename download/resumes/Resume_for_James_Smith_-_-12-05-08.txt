JAMES S. SMITH, JR., Ph.D.
President & Toxicologist
Principal Scientist

Experience Summary
Dr. James S. Smith, Jr. has 20 years of professional experience as a toxicologist and risk assessor, 5
years within the Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and 15 years consulting in the environmental sciences. He has a multidisciplinary background
in the biological and chemical sciences that includes extensive study and research in the fields of
carcinogenesis, biology, immunology, biochemistry, molecular genetics, and neurobiology. Dr. Smith
has a thorough understanding of the toxicology of hazardous metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
and polychlorinated dioxins, furans, and biphenyls. He has derived site-specific risk-based cleanup
levels and performed human health risk assessments at CERCLA, RCRA, and state lead sites. Special
areas of expertise include derivation and use of chemical-specific information on bioavailability,
evaluation of endocrine disruptors, use of dioxin toxic equivalency factors (TEF), and the use of the
estimated order of potency (EOP) approach for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds.
Dr. Smith successfully uses new technologies and methods to derive alternative cleanup levels for
compounds at hazardous waste sites. Dr. Smith uses the best available scientific information and
techniques in the development of practical and cost effective solutions to environmental problems.
