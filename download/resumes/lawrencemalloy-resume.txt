RESUME
A successful career of over 25 years has included worldwide travel for an international
clientele shooting commercials, features, documentaries, and episodic television. His
passionate approach and technical mastery have earned some of the industries highest
honors in visual communications. In past years his commercial images have been
circulated world wide, and won top honors from the IABC (International Association of
Business Communicators) for as many as 7 consecutive years. More recently Lawrence
received his 6th coveted “Telly Award” for his Cinematography and Special Effects, in the
category of “Best Syndicated Children’s Series” with Warner Home Video. In the last
year his film “The Guardians” took the New York Film Festival’s Best Family Film Award.
At the same time his documentary on LA Harbor earned 4 more prestigious Aurora
Awards For Excellence. This year at the New York Film Festival his film “The Game”
took Best Psychological Thriller.
A young, dedicated, and ambitious photographer, hell bent on perfection, Lawrence
straight-lined his career by seeking out and earning the respect, and mentorship, of a
number of Hollywood’s legends. Inspired and encouraged by an early teacher, an aging
Ansel Adams, a top Nature Photographer known around the world, Lawrence grew his
still photographic career to the limits, commercially, and artistically. Though enjoying
great success, Lawrence was not yet satisfied. He then took on the challenge to set
aside his still photography and master the complexities of filmmaking.
After a short, but intense, two years he was managing the camera department for
Panavision rival Otto Nemenz Int. He worked with, and received instruction from,
Arriflex Master Urgan Mianardis, studied optics from Century Precession Optics, power
management from Anton Bauer, camera control from John Fisher (Academy Award
winner for the Fisher Dolly), grip and electrical from the infamous Ray Jones (Emmy
Award Winning Key Grip for “60 Minutes”), and the list goes on. Personally preparing
the camera packages for the top DPs in the business, he quickly learned their skills, and
their tricks, while providing the technical answers they needed. Driven by the belief, that
greatness can only be limited by knowledge, he continues to be inventive, creative, and
a leader in his field, pushing the limits of HD, taking camera motion, and lighting, to it’s
ultimate expression.
One of his most recent full-length features “The Guardians”, first in the trilogy, was shot
in just 7 weeks on location in Winter Garden Florida. Shot in 24p HD for Film-out, this
groundbreaking children’s film introduces TGK, EMI Capital’s new music group, and
cameos Disney Channel’s superstars B5. Key to the success of the film was conquering
the challenges of Florida’s weather and managing the extensive camera, staging, and
lighting required for the concert sequences. Recently premiered, the film is receiving
rave reviews for its exceptional Cinematography.
