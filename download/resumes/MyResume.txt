EXPERIENCE
Strategik Solutions ASP.Net, PHP
Denver, CO

I work on ASP.Net C# and PHP websites. The ASP.Net projects included a realty tour site for realtors selling a

was to build a tool for generating the sites. The project was very successful. PHP projects included developing
CRUD user interfaces working with MySql tables. To facilitate this development, I implemented a
DataGridView class. This allowed me to quickly implement CRUD user interfaces with such features as
pagination, sorting, editing, and deleting.
