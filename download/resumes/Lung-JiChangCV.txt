Current Research Interests
My laboratory has been developing oncoretroviral and lentiviral vectors as gene transfer tools
and uses innovative approaches to study the development of stem cells and functional immune
cells. The emphasis of research has been to translate basic science into clinical treatment for
genetic diseases, infectious diseases and cancer. Research activities include characterization of
cellular and immune modulatory factors that are essential to the development of protective
immunity in patients. Innovative immunotherapy approaches are developed for the treatment of
infections and cancer. The long-term goal is to translate basic scientific discovery into clinical
applications.
